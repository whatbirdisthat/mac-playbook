# Mac Playbook

## A no-frills set-up-my-mac script

	Why are you so obsessed with automatically .....

> Because automate.

### I have blanked my mac and re-run this a few times
### And it works.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts
```

The above will run the playbook on localhost.

This assumes you have:

1. Made yourself sudo
2. Installed homebrew
3. Installed Ansible.

> Sheesh. That's a lot of messing around so we can automatically all the things....

Hah. Wait until we install `Pass` ... there's manual in there too :(

BUT!

### This will set up a lot of stuff.

TODO: remove the TODOs
